Onitama is somewhat reminiscent of chess and rather addictive with its dynamic game mechanic in which warriors face off so their master may win the game. Concentration and luck are the only weapons you'll have at your disposal! You'll need to fully master mind and body to defeat your opponents.\r\n\r\nTHINK STRATEGY! \r\nEvery opponent has four warriors and one elder at their disposal. The objective is simple: win the battle. To do so, you must either capture your opponent's elder or take their place in the temple arch. The game is easy to play, but you'll need time to become a true master. Although, not really... Onitama is the ideal strategy game for exercising your mind, as you'll have to think ahead about moves! The moves you're allowed to make are determined by five cards which are drawn at random, shown face-up, and shared between players. Each card corresponds to an animal and sets out a specific move that you have to follow. When you play a card, you must place it between you and your opponent and pick up the previously played card, and so on. This way, both players have the exact same chance of winning the game.\r\n\r\nIT'S ALL ABOUT ANALYSIS… \r\nThe key to success in this simple, elegant type of combat is to stay calm and concentrate. The Shrine of Onitama is a sacred ground where foresight is necessary. Animal spirits will guide you on the perilous path and allow you to gain true wisdom. In short, it's an elegant and simple game that captures the essence of martial arts. The game design and calligraphy will make your gaming experience a unique and unforgettable one. \r\n\r\nPLAY ON YOUR OWN OR WITH OTHERS\r\nPlay against the computer on your own, or against your friends. Fight duels on the same device using pass and play mode. Bored of beating your friends? Connect your Asmodee account and face the best players in the world online! You can also customize your game with new boards, pieces, and music, or get a pack of 16 additional cards by purchasing extensions. \r\n\r\nFEATURES: \r\n-Full game \r\n-Solo (several difficulty levels vs artificial intelligence) \r\n-Pass and play (unlock by connecting Asmodee account) \r\n-Online mode\r\n-Sensei's Path extension (20 new cards) \r\n-Customize boards with new music (medieval and science fiction)","descriptionHTML":"Immerse yourself in an ancient Japanese setting and discover Onitama, an exciting, fast-paced strategy game!

There is no sequence as to who goes first. Either one can go first. But in general, the player who initiates the challenge should normally go first in entering their piece’s rank. The player does this by selecting the rank from a drop down. After which the player confirms the selection by pressing the rank’s image. This confirmation step is important because it not only finalizes the selection but also will hide from the display what was selected. The opposing player will then be given the chance to perform the same rank selection and confirmation steps.  \r\n\r\nAfter both players have entered and confirmed their pieces ranks, an ADJUDICATE button is displayed. Pressing this button will reveal the winning player. Either player may press this button. To start another adjudication, a RESTART button is pressed.\r\n\r\nFEATURE TO HELP IN POST-MATCH ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThis app has a Show History option to display a list of past adjudications. However, before the list can be displayed, the user is prompted to enter a passcode. This passcode input process has been added to deter anyone from using this feature to peep into pass adjudications during a match. It is envisaged that this feature will be used only for post-match analysis. \r\n\r\nOnly the past 50 adjudications are saved by the app. This limit is mainly to save memory resources.

Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or \"bonus\" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll of Ludo Star is also a 6, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.\r\n\r\nIf the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. There are no \"safe\" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.\r\n\r\nPlay this awesome game of Royal, Ludo Star, Queens and Kings.
