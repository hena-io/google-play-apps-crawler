Com design moderno e atrativo e com dinâmicas interessantes nos utilizamos desta forma de entretenimento para ajudar a criança a memorizar intuitivamente partes importantes de cada história, enquanto ela se diverte.\r\n\r\n• VOCAÇÃO ESPIRITUAL\r\nUm maravilhoso e edificante passatempo que contém 15 perguntas, pelas quais a criança para respondê-las faz uma atividade interativa e assim, ela nem se dará conta de que responderá perguntas superimportantes que estarão contribuindo para a formação do seu caráter.\r\n\r\n• BOLETIM ONLINE\r\nAs respostas coletadas através do painel e aplicativo são registradas no boletim online. Isso permite que por avaliações sejam detectadas as áreas espirituais em que a criança precisa de mais amparo ou em que área ela se destaque. Em poder dessas informações, seja possível fortalecer as áreas fracas e potencializar ainda mais aquelas em que a criança já seja forte.\r\n\r\nComo as crianças saberão que serão monitoradas pelos pais, pois elas serão informadas que suas respostas irão para o histórico de seu boletim no SISTEMA DE AVALIAÇÃO, aos quais os pais terão acesso, elas se esforçarão para responder corretamente.

It is an effective help for all children with autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as for their families and teachers. App4Autism now has three languages: Italian, Vietnamese and English.\r\n\r\nWithin App4Autism you can access three tools: Timer, Visual Planning (Agenda) and Token Economy. The in-app manual helps parents and teachers know how to use the tools efficiently. You are able to take images and audios you use to work with your child from the storage of your device to suit the child most.\r\n\r\nThe Timer makes the passage of time visible by exploiting a strength that characterizes people with autism, namely visuo-spatial ability. This visual timer also eases the teaching as each activity is characterized by a moment of beginning and one of ending and makes it easier to move from one activity to another.\r\nThis timer tool has been designed to provide users with flexibility in customizing and editing to adapt their various purposes. In fact, users can insert photos taken at that moment through the device camera or select them (for example, photos of objects, rooms, people, and elements significant to the child) from the storage of your device. Importantly, Timer permits you to insert pleasant and interesting audios by selecting them from your device.\r\nFurthermore, the innovation of the timer is the possibility of showing a predictable and concrete limit of the time remaining to carry out an activity (the image of the current activity disappears gradually, respecting its flow of time), or to make it predictable and concrete on how much time needed to wait before enjoying an appreciative activity (the image of the appreciative activity gradually appears respecting the flow of time). Finally, the child will enjoy the appreciative activity with the audio and pleasant animation.\r\nThe Visual Planning is a concrete and visual agenda of the sequence of activities which will take place over time to increase the predictability and reduce the uncertainty. It is possible to define a sequence of activities during a limited period of the day, for example during the session of speech therapy (namely Activity Planning), during the day (Daily Activity), during the week (Weekly Planning), or to remark important events in the month (Monthly Planning). The Visual Planning is also a customizable and easy-to-use tool for editing any element very quickly, clearly and structurally.\r\nFor Activity Planning, you have possibilities for building it together with the child by selecting the number of activities, then selecting images of the activities from which he/she can choose. There are two visual signals (color and symbols) to indicate who to choose the activity.\r\nThe Weekly Planning allows you to graphically represent the succession of days of the week with  the support of customizable color codes. This allows you to unify the color codes with different contexts, for example, school, park, therapy, etc.\r\nThe Monthly Planning using calendar supports the graphical representation of the passage of time through the possibility to cross the passing day to help the child manage the wait for the occurrence of a desired event.\r\nThe Token Economy is a flexible and effective behavioral program to motivate the person to perform a skill independently and to increase the frequency of appropriate behavior. The application allows you to define in clear way the final prize through a photo taken by cameras or from your device memory). Choose the type of \"Token\" more captivating for the child among some designs already available in the app. Token Economy provides you ability to download “token” images you want from Internet.

In Cleaning game We learn how to house cleaning, dirty house cleaning, house decorating with kids house cleaning process and girl house cleaning process to make the house neat and clean like a beautiful princess house cleanup. You have to do it step by step in this games. Steps are:  \r\n\r\n                                                                   Washroom cleanup \r\n\r\n Clean the toilet. Cleaning the toilet is never fun, so it’s best to get it over with as soon as possible. Put on a pair of rubber gloves to keep your hands safe from the grime and bacteria. \r\n\r\n Clean the shower or tub. Showers are notorious for getting grimy quickly. A shower cleaner and bristled brush should work great. If you don’t have shower cleaner handy, dish washing liquid is an excellent way to get rid of the scum in the bottom of the tub, just like it cuts the grease off your dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nClean the sink. Most sinks are pretty heavy duty, but before you go to use any cleaner, make sure it’s appropriate for your surface. Once you’re sure it is, spray it down. Leave it for a minute to start eating away the bacteria and mildew, and then scrub it down with some elbow grease and a sturdy sponge. \r\n\r\n\r\nClean the glass/mirrors.First, wash your glass with a solution of warm or hot water, dish soap with a rag, sponge, or squeegee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  Cleaning the Kitchen\r\n\r\nWash the dishes.  use dishwasher. \r\nTry hand-washing dishes, too. you will rarely need to soak anything or scrub hard because the food juices won't have a chance to dry and harden. \r\n\r\nDry your dishes, too. If you don’t dry the dishes, you risk water stains on glass or bacteria festering in the water. \r\n\r\nClean the oven and microwave. Another not very fun task is the cleaning the microwave and the oven, especially if we don't clean them very often (they're easy to forget about).\r\n\r\nOrganize the cabinets. Now that you've got the hard part out of the way, it's time to get to your cabinets. \r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 Cleaning the Bedroom\r\n\r\nOrganize all the clutter. Again, we’re starting from the top down here. The first step to organizing any room is to get rid of or organize all the small bits. \r\n\r\nMake the bed. Sure, making the bed seems pretty pointless – after all, you’re just going to mess it up come nightfall.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganize your closet.  Then get to organizing, keeping like items together and the articles you wear most on top.\r\n\r\n\r\nDust, vacuum or mop, and spray a nice scent into the room. Once everything is dusted, corners of the floor included, you can vacuum or mop accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 Cleaning the Car and Garage\r\n\r\nPark your car in a shaded area.\r\nGather your supplies.\r\nFill two buckets with water.\r\nRinse the car with a hose.\r\nClean from the top of your car down to the bottom. \r\nCleaning the Wheels\r\nClean your empty garage thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      Cleaning General Living Areas\r\n\r\nClean the floor. \r\n\r\nMop your floor\r\n\r\nFight against fleas, if you have pets. \r\n\r\nDust the furniture. \r\n\r\nPolish the wood furniture. \r\n\r\nBe careful using all-purpose cleaners. \r\n\r\nOrganize the knickknacks and fluff the pillows. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           Wrapping Up Your Cleaning Session\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to clean outside, too. \r\n\r\nDo the laundry with a washing machine or by hand. \r\n\r\nDry your laundry. \r\n\r\n\r\nWalk through your house and complete any remaining room-specific cleaning necessary. \r\n      Emptying trash bins and taking out the trash\r\n      Cleaning the kitchen table\r\n      Changing bedsheets, pillowcases, and duvet covers\r\n      Cleaning walls\r\n      Clean the refrigerator","descriptionHTML":"In Sweet Baby Girl Princess Palace House Cleaning game we shall clean the all things which are necessary in a house.
