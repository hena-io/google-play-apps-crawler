A hint button can be turned on to help you see how the computer Pro player would handle your current situation.","summary":"Play spades like a pro!","installs":"1,000+","minInstalls":1000,"score":4.6666665,"scoreText":"4.7","ratings":3,"reviews":0,"histogram":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":1,"5":2},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"10M","androidVersion":"4.0","androidVersionText":"4.0 and up","developer":"Games By Post","developerId":"Games+By+Post","developerEmail":"cribbageclassic@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.gamesbypost.com","developerAddress":"2205 E Mercer St Seattle WA 98112","genre":"Card","genreId":"GAME_CARD","icon":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w5duhyEd0dYv-z-jE7xGoMnsau3FaA458xHXJ3ZrRxGg98qVluQKL_NVIR1Vc83JXQ","headerImage":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I8qLFc40hyM3oeFkjCJb5IkyqyXEknIdEj24vtnjZAldwD4wGr1C0DE1PlyZVNhNHg","screenshots":["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m4lbVLfZDrOVVIzLu80AYBYw0e8wdmomvp-H1B5aMmuenej-BHIvGNQFxQTBDicOnZQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d7ZjAm5uu_xwdQ-dG0dZgYqQmAvttehpKmnhf34fw-Rhm9LRVylv3yLmMRogCfgcNsJf","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k_noY2Vk0Re4e2CsX7SSfq63NTB3rRWZRy4D0hlc0LPS296414GRw4Xkeixy-fHmIQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E9OYXYK-qJE1uqoSr_e-ffZGzyYS5fG3-cN6L64P3q728F4AKk8KmyIct_czoQJ_zs2U","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WFASSDu9UoEX3y4xLTNMktBu7GfSywsisEQqPflWtHmxAp_RFSzwd6MTIi0PAS8RXw","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5CEFnG5PBYRGsDmJIGE-21rPEB8U-3Lvi8cryk9-mrlOmFXGS49yJGD_LtpAPD1u-hDz","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OAfYIKWAgNJ3BKG8nIRef4mxP_E3DIG2NXjwuPPfJC1lSrwz687FrV8KCw5r6B-FczMa","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SrsUP-dkFfu2Hj1IuXMK5K6yv2dxg5-m3s3V69-EUxJy3ozfWLR_OmH4RGZLWT5RoQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ltqw1mfrSWUdkBObGKCaCWclXu3K6wF_GT5uLmKobDO2629Q5NHIA9pn8L5LoxPqYk8","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ftj3vvOs6q2eX8fknr_gmCEw-KFsHbqDUviHe-JG83M1ik969at7CbTa1d5WWEz_H-E","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vdhXxo3LCRN61oSRzoGGsk9_QgPV_TJDGe8r4GKsSUNtYrsGjvsZbLzaWxXr9iHeZzo","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AWEBlASGSkhauBoCjl2nK9CW0LN1-heUwRobKSXgxCtV_re5oGxOemR8QaMyoqpbDzI","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TSIcNAGhM9F7h3CfkBCCZd5UQdYRiH395Q2yAudGLrfzLnn3zozxmVRFn6-u9gYYwSo","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qwhyV9k2La4__c9DjOAT9O0ecKT_svDBvetWKGE42lpfpDOpdIWf95nNzLI8selfbgU","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gCVGHY3jXvRqCR27J6l-tfEAuFjIBih2ZF3sLHf-Kq5LQJb3ZUlAefJI86ACtCR6SH4","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dEzvZIBxg07sIGvVnZTzyMvnGfICdJNXlWgRmBr8JuTIsJ8kVu-EG21ylzZ2ZPpHm-c","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/remBQegRr6ulw3o0heEmiNSfI7hosA0Xrei6E_3ejdRpgyvnr37EthEXMJ1m4UTkvbmr","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Wn5PGc9ke5pcL_fimbhuYm0zRISufKX63dzi3VevIyixXnYWeCmtdry1uDtQs-geAebQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/czj8k3hkzscejVpWqEuNNu57b2hqMSwCdWsqwHjfu3nDCti9d7z8_9n2yIpfERNOff8","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DyHyLnaaVVM_6fL_e-jSLHdQn9XiPgov4F6UwC4sk6dlgvGhAFgJYYqezJIFTZ-a0No","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BulhVM9tCd0pIgEKNisvTRyOKGTuAu4aFi4hSQsRqDBYeUmBCAs8AD37_HMLzeqFg6w","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XaBhhgGiVolRI95YVNI2XCYOnsUJH9YlMGM8oxxMMbvqd-46DgYRGXTw8TWTTmES-Q","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QwawdAPNh9jj8R0oBJJaW4TTs0zpJo1bKp-fdmkOM_q6PM3Ei19kr4iKEDJzO48E6RE","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0cqPoylxuyUAyx7PfP_JKW0FoaHNaMvC6p8nZ-FPoT89vQF0HCo9Ky37C3WZsiKF_S8"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mUQ-mi1hfE?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8mUQ-mi1hfE/hqdefault.jpg","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Sep 5, 2018","updated":1536166163000,"version":"1.0","recentChanges":"Play spades like a pro!","comments":[],"appId":"com.gamesbypost.spadescardclassic","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamesbypost.spadescardclassic&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Lucky Keno Numbers Bonus Casino Games Free","description":"Keno is one of the popular games played in casinos & online through out the world.

Play anywhere, with three intelligent computer opponents that feel so realistic it's like they’re sitting at the table with you. This popular card game is a family favorite.

It is played with a standard set of 52 playing cards and is closely related to other trick-taking games like Hearts, Euchre, Bridge and Whist.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to take at least the number of tricks that were bid before play of the hand began. Before the game begins, each player decides how many tricks he/she will be able to take. Adventurous players can decide to bid nil or blind nil. No suit is named, as spades are always trump.\r\n\r\nThe first player begins the game and it will continue in a clockwise order. The next player must play a card in the same suit, if possible. If not, he/she may play a trump or discard.\r\n\r\nThe player who plays the highest trump wins the trick but if no trump was played then the player who played the highest card in the led suit takes it. That player will lead the next trick.\r\n\r\nThe game will continue on like this until everyone runs out of cards. Each hand consists of 13 tricks. Spades can’t be led with unless another player has previously played one or if there aren’t any other options.\r\n\r\nThe player or partnership with the highest score at the end of the game is awarded the win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPADES TERMINOLOGY\r\n\r\n♠️ Bidding: When a player looks at his/her hand before a trick and estimates how many tricks they will win in that round\r\n♠️ Trick: When one card is played by each player. A trick is won by whoever played the highest card in the suit, or the highest spade\r\n♠️ Trump: A card that has greater power than all other cards. In the case of this game, spades trump all other suits\r\n♠️ Following Suit: Players must follow the suit of the first card played in each trick, if possible\r\n♠️ Hand: The cards held by one player\r\n♠️ Breaking Spades: Spades are broken when a player cannot follow suit and chooses to play a spade\r\n♠️ Partnership: When you work with the player opposite you to achieve a total number of bids\r\n♠️ Bag: A bag (sometimes called a sandbag) is collected for each extra trick won beyond the player’s bid. When a set number of bags are collected a penalty is assessed \r\n♠️ Nil Bid: A risky bid of 0 where players stand to win big but risk an equally large penalty\r\n♠️ Blind Nil Bid: An even riskier nil bid without looking at the hand before the round begins, which awards or deducts twice the points as a nil bid\r\n\r\n\r\nTIPS\r\n\r\n♠️ Keep track of cards that have been played! There are 13 cards of each suit in the deck. Play around the cards you know are remaining in the deck\r\n♠️ Voiding a suit (getting rid of all cards of a specific suit in your hand) is a great way to control the tricks you take with a spade\r\n♠️ Pay attention to your partner’s play and avoid taking tricks they intend to win\r\n♠️ Taking extra tricks can sometimes be a good way to stop your opponents from achieving their bids, resulting in big penalties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at uv-support@magmic.com. \r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\nFAN PAGES\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter and Like us on Facebook!\r\nwww.twitter.com/magmic\r\nwww.facebook.com/magmic","descriptionHTML":"Play a relaxing Spades game without limits. 100% free!<br><br>Play the best classic Spades game designed specifically for Android!

He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild &#39;J&#39; card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.<br><br>Please help us to fix possible errors.

Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit, such as 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not). A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.\r\n\r\nThe deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a three-card set and a three-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.\r\n\r\n**Gin Rummy Variations**\r\n\r\nGin Rummy\r\nIn standard gin, only a player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock. Knocking with 0 points of deadwood is known as going Gin or having a Gin hand, while knocking with deadwood points is known as going down.\r\n\r\nStraight Gin Rummy\r\nIs a version of Gin Rummy in which there is no knocking. Both players attempt to get gin, and the player who gins first is the winner.\r\n\r\nOklahoma Gin Rummy\r\nIn this popular variation the value of the original face up card determines the maximum count of unmatched cards with which it is possible to knock. Pictures denote 10 as usual. So if a seven is turned up, in order to knock you must reduce your count to 7 or fewer.\r\n\r\n* FEATURES *\r\n-Interactive UI and animations effects.\r\n-Gin Rummy Offline have also Leader board is avail for compete to other world-wide player.

Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit, such as 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not). A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.<br><br>The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a three-card set and a three-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.<br><br>**Gin Rummy Variations**<br><br>Gin Rummy<br>In standard gin, only a player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock. Knocking with 0 points of deadwood is known as going Gin or having a Gin hand, while knocking with deadwood points is known as going down.<br><br>Straight Gin Rummy<br>Is a version of Gin Rummy in which there is no knocking. Both players attempt to get gin, and the player who gins first is the winner.<br><br>Oklahoma Gin Rummy<br>In this popular variation the value of the original face up card determines the maximum count of unmatched cards with which it is possible to knock. Pictures denote 10 as usual. So if a seven is turned up, in order to knock you must reduce your count to 7 or fewer.<br><br>* FEATURES *<br>-Interactive UI and animations effects.<br>-Gin Rummy Offline have also Leader board is avail for compete to other world-wide player.

At the start of the game, a player is the dealer. The meaning of the dealer lies in that he can have 14 tiles, while other players can only have 13 ones.The game is over after each of the four players has acted as the dealer in turn for four times.\r\n     The purpose of Mahjong is to gather together four sequences or triplets with 14 tiles, plus a couple of pairs (few special points are not composed of sequences and triplets, see the introduction about points below). Each sequence or triplet is composed of three tiles, while the pair of two same tiles. The so-called sequence consists of three tiles of consecutive numbers, such as Character Three, Character Four and Character Five, while the so-called triplet of three same tiles. The one that first gathers together four sequences or triplets and a couple of pairs (or special points) wins. The other three must give the winner money in different amounts according to points.\r\n        At the start of the game, the dealer discards the most useless tile, while all other three players are entitled to have the discarded tile. The dealer’s opponent on the right (player on the right) has the right to chow, pong or kong that tile, while the other two players can only pong or kong it. To chow means that if you want to gather together a sequence, and you already have two tiles of the sequence, for example, you already have Bamboo Four and Bamboo Five, while your opponent on the left happens to discard Bamboo Three, you can chow it to gather together a sequence. To pong means that if you want to gather together a triplet, and you already have two tiles of the triplet, for instance, you have had two tiles of Dot Nine, you can pong if anyone discards Dot Nine. To kong means that if you already have a closed triplet, say, you already have three tiles of Character Five, you can kong if anyone discards Character Five. If the players want to chow, pong and kong at the same time, the one wanting to pong or kong has the priority. Anyone that chows, pongs or kongs must expose the tiles chowed, ponged or konged without making any change. If one discards a tile, but nobody chows, pongs or kongs, the opponent on the right can withdraw a tile from the stack, which is called drawing. There is another situation of kong:if you have an triplet(exposed or closed), say, you already have three tiles of Dragon Green but you draw a tile of Dragon Green when drawing, you can also kong. The player konging tiles must withdraw a tile from the end of the stack. Of course, no matter whether you chow, pong or draw, you must discard a tile after the action to maintain 13 tiles.\r\n      After the tiles in your hand are all useful and you only need the fourteenth one to win, and now you are in the stage of ready hand. For example, you have gathered together three sequences, a triplet and a tile of East Wind, you can declare a win if anyone discards or you self-draw a tile of East Wind (you have to gather together special tiles in case of winning special points). In many cases, you can wait for more than one necessary tile, which will grant you more opportunities to win. For example, if you have gathered together two sequences, a triplet and a couple of pairs, and there remains an incomplete sequence of Character Two and Character Three, you may wait for Character One or Character Four to win.","descriptionHTML":"Mahjong 13 tile For IOS:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id551252620?mt=8 ,<br><br>Real mahjong game, world series of mahjong, international mahjong.Top rated majhong games in china so far.There is a detailed instruction in game,you can learn to play Mahjong even if you never heard of it before.

It can be played as either a partnership or solo/\"cutthroat\" game. The object is to take at least the number of tricks (also known as \"books\") that were bid before play of the hand began. Spades are always trump. Other suits have no intrinsic value during play, but a card of the suit led in the current trick will beat a card of any other suit except a Spade.

Each player's or team's trick count is then compared to their contract. If the player or team made at least the number of tricks bid, 10 points for each bid trick are awarded (a bid of 5 would earn 50 points if made). If a team did not make their contract, they were \"set\", 10 points for each bid trick are deducted from the team's score (e.g.: six bid and any number less than six taken results in minus 60 points).\r\nIf a player/team took more tricks than they bid, a single point is scored for each overt rick, called an \"overt rick\", \"bag\" or \"sandbag\" (a bid of 5 tricks with 6 tricks taken results in a score of 51 points).\r\n\r\n♠♠♠ VARIATIONS ♠♠♠\r\n◙ SOLO :- No partnership,no blind nil.

This significantly increases the level of complexity and strategy involved in the course of play.\r\n\r\nAccording to the most commonly played Rummy 500 rules, points are scored for cards that are melded, and points are lost for cards that are not melded (ie deadwood) and remain in a player’s hand when someone goes out.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully enjoy rummy 500, there are a few rules of the game you should know along with tips and strategies to help you become a better player. This is a game that can be very fast paced and alertness is the key to winning or at least making a good show.\r\n\r\n• The game, like most can be played with 2-4 players\r\n• Only one deck with jokers is used\r\n• 7 cards are distributed to each player\r\n• The objective is to be the first player to reach the goal of 500 points.\r\n• Even if there is more than one player that makes it to the target, only the highest scoring player will be declared the winner.\r\n• You have to form sets and sequences. Sets are any 3-4 cards of the same rank and a sequence are same suit cards in order, 3 or more cards. This is how scoring is done in rummy 500, the sets and sequences are tabulated according to the values of each card.\r\n• Game play consists of drawing a card to start your turn and discarding to end the turn.\r\n• There is a third choice during the turn and this is to lay down a meld or add to a meld someone else has made. This second move is referred to as building.\r\n• The jokers are considered “wild” cards and can be used as any other card in a set or sequence.\r\n• You can pick up one or several of the discarded cards but you have to use the last one played.\r\n• When taking cards from the discard pile you have to use it immediately to form a meld or the move is invalid.\r\n• All of the royalty cards are worth 10 points, the ace can be valued at 11 points depending on its value place in a meld and it is 15 penalty points if you get caught with it. The Joker counts as the value of the card it replaces and adds 15 penalty points.\r\n• Each game is made up of a series of rounds.\r\n• The score from each round is added in succession. When the total point of any player reaches the target score or exceeds it, that player is said to be the winner.\r\n• Game ends when target is reached, if there is a tie a play off is started and the winner of this gets the pot.\r\n\r\nAwesome Features of Rummy 500\r\n\r\n✔ Resume Unfinished game.\r\n✔ Challenging Artificial Intelligence.\r\n✔ Statistics.\r\n✔ Update Profile Picture & update Username.\r\n✔ Select table of particular bet amount.\r\n✔ Game settings includes i)Animation speed ii)Sounds iii)Vibrations.\r\n✔ Manually rearrange cards or auto sort.\r\n✔ Daily Bonus.\r\n✔ Hourly Bonus\r\n✔ Level Up Bonus.\r\n✔ Achievements.\r\n✔ Daily Quests.\r\n✔ Spinner Bonus.\r\n✔ Get Free Coins by Inviting Friends.\r\n✔ Leader board.\r\n✔ Customized Rooms\r\n✔ Simple tutorial to help beginners get in the game fast.\r\n\r\nIf you like Indian Rummy, Gin Rummy and Canasta, or other card games you will love this game.
