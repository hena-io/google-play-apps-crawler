Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit, such as 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not). A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.\r\n\r\nThe deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a three-card set and a three-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.\r\n\r\n**Gin Rummy Variations**\r\n\r\nGin Rummy\r\nIn standard gin, only a player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock. Knocking with 0 points of deadwood is known as going Gin or having a Gin hand, while knocking with deadwood points is known as going down.\r\n\r\nStraight Gin Rummy\r\nIs a version of Gin Rummy in which there is no knocking. Both players attempt to get gin, and the player who gins first is the winner.\r\n\r\nOklahoma Gin Rummy\r\nIn this popular variation the value of the original face up card determines the maximum count of unmatched cards with which it is possible to knock. Pictures denote 10 as usual. So if a seven is turned up, in order to knock you must reduce your count to 7 or fewer.\r\n\r\n* FEATURES *\r\n-Interactive UI and animations effects.\r\n-Gin Rummy Offline have also Leader board is avail for compete to other world-wide player. Google play center is helping to find out players position in leader board.\r\n-Weekly quests available with existing deals to get extra bonus.\r\n-Best sounds effects and easy controls to group cards.\r\n-Daily and time based bonus in game for more interesting it.\r\n-Easy Controls to user can easily take and throw card from suit.

Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit, such as 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not). A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.<br><br>The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a three-card set and a three-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.<br><br>**Gin Rummy Variations**<br><br>Gin Rummy<br>In standard gin, only a player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock. Knocking with 0 points of deadwood is known as going Gin or having a Gin hand, while knocking with deadwood points is known as going down.<br><br>Straight Gin Rummy<br>Is a version of Gin Rummy in which there is no knocking. Both players attempt to get gin, and the player who gins first is the winner.<br><br>Oklahoma Gin Rummy<br>In this popular variation the value of the original face up card determines the maximum count of unmatched cards with which it is possible to knock. Pictures denote 10 as usual. So if a seven is turned up, in order to knock you must reduce your count to 7 or fewer.<br><br>* FEATURES *<br>-Interactive UI and animations effects.<br>-Gin Rummy Offline have also Leader board is avail for compete to other world-wide player.

Unlike games like Marriage and 29, these games are pretty easy to learn and play. We tried to bring all those games in a single game, so you can enjoy different games.\r\n\r\nCallbreak\r\nCallbreak is a relatively long-run game played with 52 cards deck between 4 players with 13 cards each. It's game rules are pretty easy to learn; you can learn to play this trick-taking card game within minutes.There are 5 rounds in callbreak game including 13 trick in one round. For each deal, player must play the same suit card. Spade is default trump card in callbreak.  The player with highest deals after 5 rounds will be the winner. Callbreak multiplayer is one of the most popular card games played in Nepal and surrounding countries of south Asia. You can pick your bid, play with competitive opponents, make a correct bid for every deal to show off your skills and trick. Currently we're trying to build a multiplayer platform for Callbreak, so please stay tuned.\r\n\r\nKitti\r\nKitti is a short, fun game played with 9 cards each between 2-5 players. In Kitti you arrange the three groups of cards, 3 in each. Just like Teen-Patti or Faras, but to win the round, you should win two shows consecutively. Unlike call break, you show three cards at a time. Once the Kitti cards are arranged in three groups of three cards each, you show one group at a time, and compare with the other players' group. If your group of cards wins, you win that one show. The Kitti game runs for three shows each round. If nobody wins the round (ie. no consecutive winning shows), we call it a Kitti, and shuffle the cards again.\r\n\r\nSolitaire Classic\r\nAfter Call Break, Solitaire is probably the most played card game ever. This game includes a classic version of solitaire game that you used to play in a PC. Solitaire game is pretty easy to play and the rules are simple.\r\n\r\nJutpatti\r\nJutpatti is a pretty simple game played by children, or beginners. Jutpatti means \"pair cards\". You can distribute 3 to 11 cards between two or more players, and keep half of the shuffled cards face down. Turn by turn you pick the card from the face-down deck, or the one that the previous player throws. Once you pick the card, you have an even number of cards in your hand. Your target is to make sure there is a pair for every number. In Jutpatti, a joker is assigned right after distributing the cards. The joker is the next card in the deck, that is shown with face-up, and put besides or under the remaining cards. Joker is not the card that's face down, but the +1 cards. For example, if you turned 8 as face up, 9 is the joker; if J is face up then Q is the joker. A joker can be used as a replacement for any card to make a pair with. Most people who play Call Break love this game, so we included it in the game.\r\n\r\nWe're working to include even more card games, include more controls and options in existing games, and building a multiplayer platform. Once the platform is ready you can play Callbreak multiplayer with your friends over the internet or offline with a local hotspot. Stay tuned for more games like Rummy, Dhumball, 29 Game and Marriage.\r\n \r\nPlease send us your feedback, and we'll improve the game for you.\r\n\r\nThank you for playing Callbreak and more.","descriptionHTML":"Callbreak, Kitti, Solitaire and Jutpatti are the most popular games among starting players.
