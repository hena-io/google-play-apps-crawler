Form your own band by recruiting talent from over 150 artists across 6 unique labels, or enjoy creating your own stars with the editor. Then record hits that will top the charts and take them on the road to over 20 different venues - including authentic reviews and news reports that determine your legacy. Like \"A Rockstar At My Hamster\" for the 21st century, Popscene leaves no stone unturned to do for music what Wrestling Revolution did for wrestling! The game is free to download, with the option to purchase a \"backstage pass\" for even more content.\r\n\r\n* Please note that the MP3 player function may not be compatible with some devices. If this affects you, consider turning off MP3 music in the options.\r\n\r\nPLAYING GUIDE:\r\nPopscene divides the music making process into entertainment (represented by stars) and artistry (represented by hearts). As in real life, popular music is more likely to shoot up the charts and draw fans - but without substance, the success may be short-lived.

Each week, depending on the size of your team and their collective attitude, new songs may be recorded.

Note Flash is the ONLY app which also has accidentals (sharp and flat notes) along with ledger lines for advanced players. Note Flash is also the ONLY app to show graphs on your progress in recognizing notes faster. This way you will know which notes you are spending more time thinking.\r\n\r\n**How to use**\r\n\r\nPlay the Note shown on screen on the piano and the app will listen via the microphone. You must play in the correct octave too - Note Flash is very intelligent to recognize the correct octaves.\r\n\r\nIf played correct, the app shows a new note on screen. If you can't remember, then you can tap \"Show Hint\". The app is built for infinite practice which encourages practice more as it makes note reading into a game.\r\n\r\nNote Flash learns which note you are getting wrong or spending more time thinking and shows you more often. You can view your progress graphs for each note and both staff. This way you will know exactly how long you spend thinking of each note and how it's improving!\r\n\r\nYou can select which hand you would like to practice or you can do both randomly. You can also choose to show accidentals - sharp, flats as well enable ledger lines for more advanced students.\r\n\r\nThe app comes with a variety of beautiful themes and you can use your own picture too for the theme.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the app needs microphone access to listen to your piano.
