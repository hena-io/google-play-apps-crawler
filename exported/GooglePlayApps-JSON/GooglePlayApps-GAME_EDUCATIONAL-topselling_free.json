Better yet, what if you could choose whichever KinToons characters you want to sing those songs?  And to sing them in any order you like!\r\n\r\nYour favorite KinToons’ characters -- Janet, Merle, Uga, and Paolo -- are back in a new and exciting talking and singing game – Nursery Rhyme DJ!

Go from blocks to “bloxels” instantly! \r\n\r\nWhen your game is ready to share, post it to the Bloxels Infinity Wall (account with parental consent required). The community of 13-bit builders can explore each other’s gaming worlds, playing games and sharing elements. Game developers earn coins when others play their games. They can then use the coins to buy content from other games -- you decide which content is shareable. The elements can then be customized to fix and mix into the buyer’s game. Let your game evolve, create new games and see your imagination come to life!\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Bloxels Gameboard is not required, however some advanced features require the Bloxels Starter Kit, available at bloxelsbuilder.com and at major retailers.\r\n\r\nLearn more and watch tutorial videos at kids.bloxelsbuilder.com. \r\n\r\nTo download activities, lesson plans, and to purchase the Bloxels Starter Kit at discounted prices visit bloxelsbuilder.com/edu\r\n\r\nFor the best experience, we recommend: \r\n\r\nAndroid Lolipop 5+\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing issues please email us at support@bloxelsbuilder.com or visit our new help desk at support.bloxelsbuilder.com.

Kids, together with their parents, can create their own little masterpieces, creating similar effects to the ones acquired on paper. The game was created with the youngest in mind (tested on four- and five-year-olds), but older kids and grown-ups will also have lots of color-splashing fun here.\r\n \r\nWe can play in the following way: \r\n- we color pre-prepared images selected from the library,\r\n- or we create our own \"masterpieces\" using provided painting supplies.\r\n\r\nLittle kids will find here many pictures to color with a bucket tool that fills large areas at once. Older kids and adults can try drawing their own creatures and scenes, and color them with a wash of paint, crayon or spray paint. We can also add highlights and shadows, correct mistakes with eraser, use undo and redo functionality or change the size of our preferred coloring tool.\r\n\r\nYou can decorate the image with small colorful stamps to make it even more interesting.\r\n \r\nWe can pick colors from several color palettes - there are 14 colors in each one. Every color can be swapped for another according to your needs and preferences. To do this use the extended color palette and the color field and the color slider to adjust the hue and shade to any color you want.

The game was created with the youngest in mind (tested on four- and five-year-olds), but older kids and grown-ups will also have lots of color-splashing fun here.<br> <br>We can play in the following way: <br>- we color pre-prepared images selected from the library,<br>- or we create our own &quot;masterpieces&quot; using provided painting supplies.<br><br>Little kids will find here many pictures to color with a bucket tool that fills large areas at once. Older kids and adults can try drawing their own creatures and scenes, and color them with a wash of paint, crayon or spray paint. We can also add highlights and shadows, correct mistakes with eraser, use undo and redo functionality or change the size of our preferred coloring tool.<br><br>You can decorate the image with small colorful stamps to make it even more interesting.<br> <br>We can pick colors from several color palettes - there are 14 colors in each one. Every color can be swapped for another according to your needs and preferences. To do this use the extended color palette and the color field and the color slider to adjust the hue and shade to any color you want.  Use the picker tool to pick the color from the image you are coloring.<br> <br>The images are grouped in the following categories:<br>- for girls - princesses, castles and unicorns,<br>- for boys - dinosaurs, vehicles and adventure, <br><br>- animals and nature,<br>- fruit and vegetables,<br>- holidays and special occiasions: Christmas and winter, Halloween, Easter, Valentine&#39;s Day.  <br> <br>Additional features:<br>- save your own projects and return to them later on,<br>- share your saved images through e-mail or on Facebook,<br>- return to the project you&#39;re working on whenever you want,<br>- listen to the pleasant music in the background (with an option to turn it off),<br>- zoom in and out of image to make coloring more precise,<br>- decorate images with fun colorful stamps.","summary":"Color tons of cute coloring pages with fun and easy-to-use painting

numbers for toddlers - educational game","description":"“Learning numbers for toddlers” is one of our educational games for kids whose parents are interested in early education of their babies especially in the field of maths - in baby numbers and counting. Our numbers game will teach the child to differentiate numbers 1-9 and also offer some mini number learning games to fix the received knowledge.\r\nOur maths game being a part of our games for kindergarten is one of the best games to learn numbers. Main advantages of our learning app for preschoolers:\r\nLearn numbers for children from 0 to 9. It’s not numbers 1 to 100 because such big numerals are appropriate as educational apps for kids of older ages. The toddler will learn to name numbers correctly, compare and differentiate them.\r\nThe preschool game contains 3 mini game tasks which will help parents check and consolidate the knowledge about numbers 1 to 20 that their babies have acquired. \r\nOur game for nursery will give the baby not only the initial knowledge of 123 and math but also train fine motor skills, attentiveness, memory, intelligence, perseverance and persistence in achieving goals. All these things will help the kid study better at school in the near future.\r\nThe game for kindergarteners has a bright and catchy design so a young mathematician will not want to part with our fun and interactive numbers.\r\nLittle students can learn numbers in 7 languages - in English, Russian, Italian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese. The game is voices by native speakers with perfect pronunciation and clear diction. If a child knows names of numbers in other languages it will help him or her study foreign languages better as well as it will be useful during trips abroad.\r\nThere are some number songs and other merry melodies and sounds that make learning how to count numbers vivid, interesting and more effective.\r\nThe game with number spelling has an intuitive and clear interface, amazing motions and inspiring elements that will make children love every bit of this game.\r\nThe game was designed for small kids age 2, age 3, 3 years to 4 years, as well as for 4 to 5 year kid, both boys and girls. \r\nYou can download the education app for kids for free. Our free games save family budget and provide kids’ early education of high quality.\r\nHow to play and begin to study mathematics for infants:\r\nOur app with letters offers children to learn to count numbers 0 to 9. First we need get acquainted with them and alphabet. This happens as follows: one of the numbers and abc will appear in the center of the screen, followed by its proper pronunciation. The kid should carefully look at the number and repeat its name after the voice-over. It may be necessary to say the name of the number several times to pronounce it right. To re-listen to the number’s name it's enough to tap on this number. Then the child will see 3 contours, of which only one corresponds with the number shown. The child is to find the correct variant and drag the number to the chosen contour. If the choice is right, the number will flush with a bright color and the puzzle will go to the next step.\r\nNow let’s test the received knowledge playing fun mini learning games. In the 1st game the baby is to recognize and find the given numeral among 8 different variants. For every task fulfilled correctly, the child will be rewarded. The 2nd mini-game offers kids to catch the writing numbers flying across the screen. The player needs to select only the numbers that correspond to the example shown on the right. Playing the 3d kind of puzzles, the baby should burst the bubble with the same number as shown in the center of the screen in the “sun”.\r\nThe game has been created in such a way that a child can learn numbers in the most comfortable game form. For this, children's teachers, psychologists and methodologists were involved in the development of the game. Skills and knowledge gained during the game will help children to master the material more quickly in further education.","descriptionHTML":"“Learning numbers for toddlers” is one of our educational games for kids whose parents are interested in early education of their babies especially in the field of maths - in baby numbers and counting.

This app adheres to Common Core Standards for math and was designed by parents and teachers. This game is suitable for first grade, second grade, third grade and fourth grade for learning math addition, subtraction and multiplication skills.\r\n\r\nThis mental math game with 30 levels will help your child get necessary fluidity with numbers. Your child will learn math skills like addition can happen in any order for the same result, or that sum of different numbers can add up to be the same number. Math Balance aims to mix fun with learning, therefore, if you use it in school we recommend to let the child play freely through the different levels for mental math practice.\r\nThey will also end up having to use different number strategies, such as bridging and compensation which can significantly speed up their mental math computations.\r\n\r\nThese are the skills covered by Math Balance -\r\n- Developing meaning of equal sign, using, greater than and less than sign\r\n- Commutative property of addition and subtraction, later, using it and expanded form as a strategy to add.\r\n- Missing Addend strategies: x+b=c, where x is to be found, situations where difference is unknown, where there is a bigger unknown and where there is a smaller unknown -one step problems                   \r\n- Showing that addition and subtraction are inverse\r\n- Use only doubles, Use only even/odd numbers to get to a total            \r\n- 1 step word problems -Change unknown, Result unknown, start unknown\r\n- add a string of two-digit numbers (up to four numbers) by applying place value strategies and properties of operations.\r\n- Using concrete models to show addition and subtraction learning for 1st grade, 2nd grade, 3rd grade, 4th grade and 5th grade elementary school kids.\r\n- Multiplication as repeated addition\r\nFor those who follow the Core curriculum, this maps to the following common core standards - 2.OA.B.2, 2.NBT.4, 2.OA.2, 1.OA.6, 2.OA.C.3, 2.OA.1, 2.NBT.6, 2.NBT.7, 2.NBT.8, 3.NBT.2.\r\n\r\nGrade wise skills covered in Math Balance:\r\n\r\n1st grade and 2nd grade:\r\nChildren ages 6 and 7 (first grade and second grade of elementary school) practice math activities: Developing the meaning and understanding of 'equal to', 'greater than and less than' comparing numbers, simple math addition and subtraction facts, understand the properties of addition such as commutative property, additions without regrouping, showing that addition and subtraction are inverse, one step word problems with change unknown, result unknown, practice mental math with missing addend addition and subtraction math strategies, place value strategies to add a string of numbers for Grade 1 and Grade 2.\r\n\r\n3rd grade and 4th grade:\r\nFrom age 8 to 9 (third grade and fourth grade of elementary school) the math game consists of: mental arithmetic sums of two-digit numbers, mental math addition and subtraction of 10 to or from a given number, fluently add or subtract within 1000 using different mental math strategies, multiplication as repeated addition for Grade 3 and Grade 4.\r\n\r\nReasons to Play:\r\n\r\nThe best part is children will engage in learning math without realizing, due to the great adventure they are experiencing with Toby and bridges. \r\nTo do this they must overcome countless obstacles to reach Toby home.

They need to balance the bridge while doing fun math facts (addition, subtraction, multiplication).<br>Aside from being engaging math game, Math Balance has features like<br>1)\tFull alignment with key curriculum (e.g., common core, Ontario, TEKS, MAFS)<br>2)\tEmbedded in-game formative and diagnostic assessments.","summary":"Educational math games for kids of 2nd, 3rd grade - addition and subtraction","installs":"10,000+","minInstalls":10000,"score":4.3333335,"scoreText":"4.3","ratings":84,"reviews":39,"histogram":{"1":9,"2":2,"3":3,"4":8,"5":62},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"size":"31M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"Makkajai: Math Games for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th grade","developerId":"Makkajai:+Math+Games+for+1st,+2nd,+3rd,+4th+grade","developerEmail":"support@makkajai.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.makkajai.com/","developerAddress":"F-702 Roseland Residency,\nPimple Saudagar,\nNr.

The list was first prepared in 1936. Though Dr. Dolch compiled the list based on children's books of his era. The list contains 220 \"sight words\" that have to be easily recognized in order to achieve reading fluency in the English language. The original word list excludes nouns, which comprise a separate 95-word noun list. The game is designed to make children smart thinking and can recognize sounds, putting letters together words into syllables to make the children think logically to identify the structure of different English words.  \r\n \r\nMany of the original 220 Dolch words cannot be learned by pictures or \"sounded out\" using common sound/letter phonics patterns and have to be learned by sight; hence the term, \"sight words.\" The original Dolch words which compromise of 220 words and the additional 95 nouns is usually divided into grades, though for native English speakers, all the Dolch Sight Words should be learned before elementary education begins. \r\n \r\nThe app now gives an option to learn sight words for Preschool, Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 and Nouns. \r\n \r\nInstructions: \r\nDrag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the sound in each mode. \r\n \r\nEasy Mode:  \r\nChild needs to drag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the word. \r\n \r\nNormal Mode:  \r\nChild needs to drag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the sound. \r\n \r\nFeatures: \r\n* A simple and easy to understand game. \r\n* 2 different modes of spelling game. \r\n* The child can also listen to sight words to improve his/her learning process while playing.

The list was first prepared in 1936. Though Dr. Dolch compiled the list based on children&#39;s books of his era. The list contains 220 &quot;sight words&quot; that have to be easily recognized in order to achieve reading fluency in the English language. The original word list excludes nouns, which comprise a separate 95-word noun list. The game is designed to make children smart thinking and can recognize sounds, putting letters together words into syllables to make the children think logically to identify the structure of different English words.  <br> <br>Many of the original 220 Dolch words cannot be learned by pictures or &quot;sounded out&quot; using common sound/letter phonics patterns and have to be learned by sight; hence the term, &quot;sight words.&quot; The original Dolch words which compromise of 220 words and the additional 95 nouns is usually divided into grades, though for native English speakers, all the Dolch Sight Words should be learned before elementary education begins. <br> <br>The app now gives an option to learn sight words for Preschool, Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 and Nouns. <br> <br>Instructions: <br>Drag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the sound in each mode. <br> <br>Easy Mode:  <br>Child needs to drag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the word. <br> <br>Normal Mode:  <br>Child needs to drag and drop the letters to create a word correctly describe the sound. <br> <br>Features: <br>* A simple and easy to understand game. <br>* 2 different modes of spelling game. <br>* The child can also listen to sight words to improve his/her learning process while playing. The background can be muted to hear the sounds clearly. <br>* The child can play in either &#39;Play Mode&#39;. <br>* Supports all screen sizes. <br>And last but not least ***All words are available for FREE*** <br>Privacy Disclosure:  <br>As parents ourselves, EDUBUZZKIDS takes children&#39;s wellness and privacy very seriously.

Start exposing the child to numbers from when he is a year old so that he will be familiar with them by the time he reaches preschool.

If parents and preschool teachers focus on teaching numbers, the child should be comfortable recognizing and writing numbers zero through nine by the time he starts kindergarten.\r\n\r\nAt 2 to 3 years of age, typically developing children begin to use number words to 'count' as they play, showing that are beginning to explore and understand counting. By 4 years of age, many children can answer questions such as 'How many?' and 'Give me…..' questions for numbers up to 10. They understand 'more' or 'less' for small numbers, but they do not yet understand the ordinal nature of the number system, i.e., that each 'next' number represents 'one more'.\r\n\r\nParents should be encouraged to draw their child's attention to the uses of number in everyday life and engage them in games that teach counting and quantity. Starting from the childhood your children will fast learn addition and substraction and other mathematical actions. Show your children that mathematics is funny!\r\n\r\nDeveloping basic math skills through games makes learning math fun right from the beginning.\r\n\r\nOur application uses colorful images that are fun for the child to look at.

They understand &#39;more&#39; or &#39;less&#39; for small numbers, but they do not yet understand the ordinal nature of the number system, i.e., that each &#39;next&#39; number represents &#39;one more&#39;.<br><br>Parents should be encouraged to draw their child&#39;s attention to the uses of number in everyday life and engage them in games that teach counting and quantity.
