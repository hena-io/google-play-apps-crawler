Valid words boost your score and the dwindling timer; used letters disappear and new ones drop from above.\r\n\r\n\"Dropwords is a potent mixture of Scrabble, Boggle and Bejeweled! - Editor's Pick from AppEggs.com\"\r\n\r\nThe game includes six game modes: Normal, Hard, Lightning, Blocker, Relax and Untimed. Whether you just want to relax, or are looking for something challenging, there's a game mode that will suit you.\r\n\r\nThe game offers three dictionaries:\r\n1. Scrabble: contains all the 2-to-8-letter words from the SOWPODS list of Scrabble competition words. This amounts to 114575 words, including both US and UK spellings.

Learn to strategize using the Board Solver, discover how to get multiple crosswords in a single play, and always have an idea of what tiles have yet to be played. You can also use it to solve everyday problems, puzzles, and anagrams. Word Breaker has even been used in the classroom to teach English - something we think is just amazing!\r\n\r\nTOP FEATURES:\r\n- Lightning fast!\r\n- Screenshot importing reads your game board directly into Board Solver! Easily check what words you missed using this powerful feature.\r\n- Even better! The classic solver mode can work with anything! Try it with word jumbles, crosswords, hangman, and more.\r\n- Our original and still ground-breaking Ghost Mode allows you to peek at the game underneath!\r\n- Local dictionary! You never have to be online to use Word Breaker. Download your favorite dictionaries and take them on the road! Also, like everything else, dictionaries are free!\r\n- Track what’s left in the bag! Our exclusive “Remaining Tiles” screen helps you predict what letters you’ll get next!\r\n- Supports wildcards and blank tiles! Even better, you can easily tell Word Breaker what location and patterns to look for.\r\n- Highly customizable, including filters for word length!\r\n- Available is SEVEN languages, including English, Nederlands, Français, Deutsch, Italiano, Español, and Português!\r\n\r\n★ How to take a screenshot:\r\n- Press and hold “Volume Down” and “Power” for one full second.\r\n- On certain phones, this combination is “Home” and “Power.”\r\n\r\n★ Having trouble with Screenshot Importing?\r\n1) Completely zoom out before taking a screenshot. This way, the whole board is visible and Word Breaker can properly scan every tile.\r\n2) Make sure all of your playable tiles are on the tile rack, not on the game board. This ensures the results you get are valid.\r\n3) Make sure nothing is obscuring the game. Facebook Chat Heads, app trays, and notification pop-ups can all interfere with Word Breaker.","descriptionHTML":"Word Breaker, the go-to word game helper since 2011! <br><br>Aside from its ability to build words, Word Breaker is also a learning and optimization tool.

The grid looks like a crossword, but there are no normal clues. Instead you must find the right place in the grid for each word from a given list. The game has an easy to use interface. Either drag-and-drop the words to their correct position, or tap the grid and then the word.\r\nPlay with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.\r\n\r\n• Play an unlimited number of different puzzles!!\r\n• Multiple difficulty options. Start with easy puzzles. Then change the settings to play more challenging puzzles.\r\n• Game contains achievements integrated into Google Play's \"Game Services\".\r\n\r\nDesigned for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.\r\n\r\nYou can configure:\r\n\r\n1) Grid size\r\n    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.\r\n2) Screen layout\r\n    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.\r\n3) Minimum & Maximum word length\r\n     This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).\r\n4) Starting letters\r\n     The game can start with one or more letters already placed in the grid, in order to help you get started.\r\n5) Language\r\n     Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).\r\n6) Orientation\r\n    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.\r\n\r\nThis app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.\r\n\r\nEach game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.\r\nCompare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play's \"Game Services\".\r\n\r\nOther features unique to this app:\r\n\r\n1) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.\r\n2) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!\r\n3) Your can also play and fit with numbers and symbols in addition to words\r\n\r\nDictionaries available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Indonesian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian(Latin), Serbian(Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and more coming later","descriptionHTML":"Fit words into a grid in this popular game, often seen in puzzle magazines as fill-ins.

Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.\r\nPlay with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.\r\nDesigned for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.\r\nBored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. \r\n\r\nYou can configure:\r\n\r\n1) Grid size\r\n    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.\r\n2) Screen layout\r\n    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.\r\n3) Difficulty of the game\r\n    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).\r\n4) Difficulty of the words\r\n    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.\r\n5) Maximum # of words\r\n    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.\r\n6) Minimum & Maximum word length\r\n    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).\r\n7) Highlighting\r\n    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.\r\n8) Word list layout\r\n    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.\r\n9) Language\r\n    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).\r\n10) Orientation\r\n    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.\r\n11) Word categories\r\n    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.\r\n\r\nThis app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.\r\n\r\nEach game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.\r\nCompare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play's \"Game Services\".\r\n\r\nOther features unique to this app:\r\n\r\n1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.\r\n2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.\r\n3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.\r\n4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!\r\n\r\nAdditional Features planned for a future version of this app:\r\n\r\n1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden.
