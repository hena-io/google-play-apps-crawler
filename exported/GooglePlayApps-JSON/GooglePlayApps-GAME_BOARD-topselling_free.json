Really Bad Chess removes these boring restrictions and flips chess on its head.\r\n\r\nAs much as random pieces change the game in some ways, I was really surprised to notice how much the game remains the same, and how powerful some pieces are — you've never truly struggled against a pawn until you've struggled against a pawn in the back row.\r\n\r\nFor chess pros, Really Bad Chess will give you a new type of challenge — the pieces & the moves are the same, but you'll have to throw out your openings and your understanding of normal patterns of play. \r\n\r\nFor novice chess players (like most of us), Really Bad Chess greatly opens up the game. Instead of starting by studying openings, in your first games you'll get to discover the joy (and challenge!) of learning how to checkmate.\r\n\r\nI hope you have as much fun with Really Bad Chess as much as I did making it.\r\n\r\n-zach","descriptionHTML":"Really Bad Chess is just like chess, but with totally random pieces.

It’s a game of luck, strategy, and people skills.\r\n\r\nIt is also called as Business Card Game, or simply business. \r\n\r\nMonopoly is derived from The Landlord's Game, which was created by Elizabeth Magie in the United States in 1903. Monopoly has been a classic board game for over 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe game objective is to remain financially solvent while forcing opponents into bankruptcy by trading i.e. buying, selling and developing pieces of property.\r\n\r\nMonopoly is a real-estate board game for two to six players. The board consists of 40 spaces containing twenty-eight properties: (twenty-two streets (grouped into eight color groups), four railroads, and two utilities), three Chance spaces, three Community Chest spaces, a Luxury Tax space, an Income Tax space, and the four corner squares: GO, (In) Jail/Just Visiting, Free Parking, and Go to Jail.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the game, each player is given a fixed amount of play money; the players then moves around the board according to the throw of a pair of dice. Any player who lands on an unowned property may buy it, but, if he or she lands on a property owned by another player, rent must be paid to that player. \r\n\r\nIf a player acquires a monopoly- that is, If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build or develop equal houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. \r\n\r\nA player continues to travel around the board until he or she is bankrupt. Bankruptcy results in elimination from the game. The last player remaining on the board is the winner.\r\n\r\nIf a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw the top card from the respective deck and follow its instructions.\r\n\r\nMonopoly is a real estate trading game that nearly everyone plays for fun and a chance to be a  real estate tycoon.

The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up.

Onitama is somewhat reminiscent of chess and rather addictive with its dynamic game mechanic in which warriors face off so their master may win the game. Concentration and luck are the only weapons you'll have at your disposal! You'll need to fully master mind and body to defeat your opponents.\r\n\r\nTHINK STRATEGY! \r\nEvery opponent has four warriors and one elder at their disposal. The objective is simple: win the battle. To do so, you must either capture your opponent's elder or take their place in the temple arch. The game is easy to play, but you'll need time to become a true master. Although, not really... Onitama is the ideal strategy game for exercising your mind, as you'll have to think ahead about moves! The moves you're allowed to make are determined by five cards which are drawn at random, shown face-up, and shared between players. Each card corresponds to an animal and sets out a specific move that you have to follow. When you play a card, you must place it between you and your opponent and pick up the previously played card, and so on. This way, both players have the exact same chance of winning the game.\r\n\r\nIT'S ALL ABOUT ANALYSIS… \r\nThe key to success in this simple, elegant type of combat is to stay calm and concentrate. The Shrine of Onitama is a sacred ground where foresight is necessary. Animal spirits will guide you on the perilous path and allow you to gain true wisdom. In short, it's an elegant and simple game that captures the essence of martial arts. The game design and calligraphy will make your gaming experience a unique and unforgettable one. \r\n\r\nPLAY ON YOUR OWN OR WITH OTHERS\r\nPlay against the computer on your own, or against your friends. Fight duels on the same device using pass and play mode. Bored of beating your friends? Connect your Asmodee account and face the best players in the world online! You can also customize your game with new boards, pieces, and music, or get a pack of 16 additional cards by purchasing extensions. \r\n\r\nFEATURES: \r\n-Full game \r\n-Solo (several difficulty levels vs artificial intelligence) \r\n-Pass and play (unlock by connecting Asmodee account) \r\n-Online mode\r\n-Sensei's Path extension (20 new cards) \r\n-Customize boards with new music (medieval and science fiction)","descriptionHTML":"Immerse yourself in an ancient Japanese setting and discover Onitama, an exciting, fast-paced strategy game!

You can now download the best Yatzy dice game for free. \r\n\r\nYATZY is a board game with its original rules. Five dices with six sides and 15 sections to be filled in 15 rounds. It is a Scandinavian public domain dice game very similar to Poker Dice, Yacht, Generala and Cheerio. Yatzy is also known as Yachty and Farkle in different countries. You can play Yazy with your virtual buddies with high level artificial intelligence. Do not hesitate to play Yatzee with your make-believe friends. They are virtual but this prevents wasting precious time for waiting for live opponents. \r\n\r\nThis is a game of strategy and luck. Try to get the highest points possible by completing fifteen different dice combinations. Those combinations are one pair, two pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, small straight, large straight, full house, and chance for the lower section and ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, and sixes for the upper section. And we have Yatzy, the mother of them all. You can play Yatzy solitaire or against an opponent. In single player, you choose your target points and try to score higher than that. Against an opponent, you just have to score higher than your rival. \r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\n- Real dice probabilities. \r\n- Smooth graphics and game play. \r\n- Play solitaire or against an opponent. \r\n- No need for an internet connection. \r\n- Totally free, even no in-app purchases. \r\n- Two different game modes: American Yatzy and Standart Yatzy.\r\n- No banner ads. \r\n\r\nMost common typos of our game can be listed as Yatzie, Yatsy, Yazy, Yatzee, Yatze, Yahztee, Yatzi, Yhatzee and Yatzee.\r\n\r\nYatzy offline is intended for adult audiences and does not offer \"real money gambling\" or an opportunity to win real money or prizes. Practice or success at our game does not imply future success at \"real money gambling\". Enjoy this new game from SNG. Best of luck.","descriptionHTML":"Yatzy by SNG is now available on Android mobile phones and tablets with its high quality game experience.

It is the best of all board games, lets you share some wonderful time with your loved ones. Don't wait any further, get the dice rolling and play Ludo SuperStar!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also known as Pachisi, and is very similar to a Spanish board game, Parchís.\r\n\r\nThis game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. The game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world.\r\n\r\nLudo by BlackLight lets you define your own rules that suit your requirements. \r\n\r\nLudo Classic Features:\r\n- Added rules/options which are played and popular in the world.\r\n- Option to show safe cells(square) which is represented by star icon.\r\n- Option to get another turn on both dice number 1 and 6.\r\n- All the rules are optional so you can play both international version.\r\n- New modern design with wooden board.\r\n- Option to choose the dice number 6 which will start the coin.\r\n- Option to choose the number of coins to be played with 2,3 and 4.\r\n- Multiplayer in the same device, 2 and 4 player Real-Time Ludo.\r\n- Play against Computer.\r\n\r\nIn ludo the objective is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner.

It also comes from India under the name Cows and Leopards. A variant of this game is also popular in Bangladesh, where it is known as Sholo guti (Sixteen pieces). The game is similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them. However, unlike draughts and standard Alquerque, the game is played on an expanded Alquerque board consisting of four triangular boards attached to the four sides of an Alquerque board. Also, pieces can move and capture in any direction from the beginning. There is no promotion to King. Its actual closest relatives are Peralikatuma and Kotu Ellima which are also from the Indian subcontinent. The only real difference between these three closely related games is the number of pieces. In Sixteen Soldiers, each player has 16 pieces hence the name of the game. In Peralikatuma, each player has 23 pieces. In Kotu Ellima, each player has 24 pieces.

The score entered in the box depends on how well the five dice match the scoring rule for the category. Details of the scoring rules for each category are given below. As an example in Yatzy game, one of the categories is called Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category means that a player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the same value.

Classic","description":"NEW: Multiplayer Online with Facebook Friends & Bluetooth Option available now.\r\n\r\nCalling all the kings of Ludo game, here is your most popular & most loved Ludo game in its classical form. How often you all wondered if we have a Ludo game in the wooden board? The board that we used to play when we were kids. The very smell of the wood, the sketching of colors, the die (dice) and tokens that will take us back to our childhood days.\r\n\r\nI kept this very experience as my goal when I designed the game for you all to cherish those childhood moments. So, get ready and travel back to old days and rule the Ludo kingdom.\r\n\r\nABOUT\r\n\r\nLudo is a strategy board game for 2 to 4 players and is being widely played in India, Nepal, Algeria and many Asian, Latin, European countries. It is also called as Parchisi, Parcheesi, and Laadhuu. The goal is simple, each player has to race their four tokens from start to finish (home) according to rolls of a single die or dice.\r\n\r\nDESIGN\r\n\r\nYou got classic wood and neo-Ludo boards (paper & white). The wood board, die & tokens are a timeless design. It gives you a better visual experience and nostalgic feelings. The sketch marks and crystal clear tokens will make us feel the same old classic ludo board.\r\n\r\nThe board is the square shape with 3 columns of squares and supports up to 4 players (2, 3 & 4 players in combination with Computer). Each player will take one color from bright yellow, green, red and blue. You can also assign all players as Computer and quietly watch each, it is quite a lot fun. :)\r\n\r\nDIE ROLLING\r\n\r\nI built an entirely new physics engine for die-rolling mechanics that will simulate the real-time rolling of a die or dice. The physics behind die-rolling was very challenging and I am proud to be the first one to implement. This will make it look like a 3D Ludo game.\r\n\r\nSETTINGS\r\n\r\nIt has an extensive set of game settings. You can play a match in 100s of variations to favor your own country rules. Some of them include,\r\n\r\nStar Squares (safer)\r\nBarrier Squares (Squares that will stop opponents to pass by)\r\nHome Squares (Entering without returning opponent tokens)\r\nMagic No (Die result that makes a staged token to enter its starting square)\r\nToken Moving & Die Rolling Speed\r\n\r\nOFFLINE\r\n\r\nOptions to play with one or more Computer or Players or combination. You can also choose the intelligence of Computer (Trained, Expert and Strategic) to increase the complexity level. Bluetooth Game Play option also available, you can pair up your device with your opponent's devices and start a match with them offline.\r\n\r\nONLINE\r\n\r\nPlay with your friends, family or a random player across the world by logging into Google Play Games / Google Plus / Facebook or as anonymous. You have options to invite your friends or join a match hosted by your facebook and google plus friends. You can see your total wins & your rank in Global Leaderboards. There are several achievements to unlock in the kingdom of Ludo.\r\n\r\nYou can also emote your tokens, and message with your opponents while playing the match.\r\n\r\nGAME AI\r\n\r\nThe AI behind the game is built, by keeping-in-mind that the outcome of dice is always random and unpredictable whether it is thrown by player or Computer. Computer's intelligence is only to decide which tokens to choose from and to return the opponent's tokens from its squares or not. It doesn't have any control over the outcome/result of the die or dice.\r\n\r\nOTHERS\r\n\r\nPlayer Names & Colors - Can be manually decided\r\nLast Played Match - You can quit the game and play from where you left last time\r\nGame Instructions & Help - Helps you to follow the match easily\r\nMulti-color dies - One can easily understand who's turn is current\r\nDecide - Before returning your opponent's tokens in your square\r\nReal-time die feature - You can have a die or dice on your hand, and toss it. The outcome can be fed back to the game.\r\nand much more.\r\n\r\nPlease leave us your valuable feedbacks & rating, will definitely update the game with the improvements & fix the issues you report.","descriptionHTML":"NEW: Multiplayer Online with Facebook Friends &amp; Bluetooth Option available now.<br><br>Calling all the kings of Ludo game, here is your most popular &amp; most loved Ludo game in its classical form.

The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 28 dominoes, colloquially nicknamed bones, cards, tiles, tickets, stones, or spinners. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its faceinto two square ends. Each end is marked with a number of spots or is blank. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to playing cards or dice, in that a variety of games can be played with a set. There are some extended domino sets (double 9 and double 12). They are used for Mexican train, Chicken Foot and similar games. Each country has it’s own set of dominoes games: England - muggins (All fives), scandinavian countries - Bergen, Mexico - Mexican train, Spain - Matador.\r\nThe earliest mention of dominos is from Song Dynasty China. Dominoes first appeared in Italy during the 18th century, and although it is unknown how Chinese dominos developed into the modern game.\r\n\r\nGeneral rules of dominoes:\r\n\r\nBlocking game\r\nThe most basic dominos variant is for two players and requires a double six set. The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\nScoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\nDraw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nMexican train has arrived! Enjoy our dominos game with the full set of this game varieties!

In two player games, you can take turns with your friend/family to play the game on the mobile hone or tablet.  \r\n\r\nThe game comes with multiple difficulty levels from each to hard, simply use the slider to adjust the computer opponent strength.

The algorithm utilizes \"alpha-beta pruning\" to provide the computer opponent with their intelligence.  This method should provide the computer opponent with reasonable strength to challenge most casual chess players.

If you're the impatient type and wants quick games, set the difficulty level to under 3 (there are 5 difficulty levels levels in the game).\r\n\r\nIf you're a beginner chess player, we recommend using the lowest opponent difficulty.  Note that this app won't teach you how to play chess; it assumes that you know the basic rules of chess, such as what moves each piece can make (although it will highlight valid moves, you need to know chess rules to outmaneuver the opponent), or what \"check\" or \"checkmate\" means.

I understand some of you may want to be more nuanced, and I do also appreciate 4-star ratings, but please notice that they don&#39;t help much; the bad guys give very low ratings, and currently even 4 stars pull the rank down, so the only real help comes from 5-star ratings and sensible review comments.","summary":"Full featured app for the Game of Go (Baduk / Weiqi) with Steenvreter AI","installs":"10,000+","minInstalls":10000,"score":4.3854165,"scoreText":"4.4","ratings":384,"reviews":130,"histogram":{"1":26,"2":10,"3":21,"4":60,"5":267},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"4.3M","androidVersion":"2.2","androidVersionText":"2.2 and up","developer":"Erik van der Werf","developerId":"Erik+van+der+Werf","developerEmail":"erikvanderwerf@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"http://gridmaster.tengen.nl/","developerAddress":"Connector building, box 47918\nHet Eeuwsel 6, 5612 AS, Eindhoven","genre":"Board","genreId":"GAME_BOARD","icon":"https://lh3.ggpht.com/4wrD5pLaTSjfLep2nLULQFim52powo6akDQsjFFZ3cV7ANlXmo61ZTnzXo0RifEcQoY","headerImage":"https://lh5.ggpht.com/nIImaH5slVAICkdSV4D8bGO1F9vlyDaYGwOJ4M8LpW8UhtP4SxTs_zDAq54ZgFbftLWW","screenshots":["https://lh6.ggpht.com/d1WhhofiSKpg3yroP8AtXgtaEekU-tRexNIhS3l0WcA7mNYB6ibqy97lsXEmnFonnmcf","https://lh5.ggpht.com/iN7hH5YuIXF0G_jPNj2RpNY4FopduKFSLYaoyWc9dA58xBIKYdT-v60cJebuci47TaA","https://lh6.ggpht.com/qdj0QOGGRJkHRs_eipHBES-1aVuuafmUjwCNPai0-Ct1zXDDHIdp9tMlv19-S1yjZqg","https://lh4.ggpht.com/eWAl8bc98xrTbYkfZVU6OxxyTjVHBoempsUcwRaSBWB9C3vPCSrxp53cNbhGF7yguw","https://lh3.ggpht.com/cn6i-FfFLZ8jmrin6KMQpALS_yXkQe2AMIRjsMVbJpL4RqB6bbzpQVGYXAXPvK4MAI6q","https://lh3.ggpht.com/tIaJlVEeFKHjDr2gH3TBkDaHTidDD7MUbVu5nURau8A0Y5aKOz7V4c9p3fep3eYDyA","https://lh3.ggpht.com/EqOsLctz6i0a4nUFDNeq3-k0LKZH6ltuviGxOOtBtTWDIIFMb7JwzSzND9c7ihCoobQ","https://lh3.ggpht.com/SWHJp4vQZMASy5IzQd_JJp7X8hFuUhuJ9IrxkMRRiNeXlsQL2glC_KPQvGdjR6J5ZVKO","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/39IFf6kxTM72yb8oMnUmU0yXh4vrL8UrwmJFa_98f7tVRjhtA_e-OegJt0VnAYqgTiMv","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wD-J38YnQbdqvnvTwmA7iM_LwiNp7vdDRxaZTM0bxNupNwK_qQmvxM-tWkobGOpMzA","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wnAGSxWZxXtl3-tigPU37aPfwD7LLzGE3IV1eUlukFIGI8uRikqXtK_XkRbVqlofzg","https://lh3.ggpht.com/n1Cfv7LffzLTwCSvNlncigSw7anB__AbPX1jXD955cEHH7d7iBePzK59HZ6Ou7vdlDqM","https://lh3.ggpht.com/GTM1z4Ct8BI9-5jQhWP0itiO2IGgYKPq01lrlEBxJrYXQ_VCQ6V03ZnbvRRpMLQH348","https://lh6.ggpht.com/bADgEdwqGhxdJFlqEIGyJ6K8fTRLCPiEg9Fumh5TlcXGUmor9V7NXr1TUhMUi2O-G5YW","https://lh4.ggpht.com/T_6DhdTJjMTeNxy7nZpEsJeqsovZh65fYpLmViVIw18zXO5eTwH-WM77Ol5XwQnwXyw","https://lh6.ggpht.com/aMzI499ZvReL1E-CSkNaLTZT3t-72aQtOfHNEDLZqZc5A7oJWSuwjdFTGILO6S7UOfvd","https://lh3.ggpht.com/sXRrR0FejfE_Up3O2Ya4ZCQgbhiZp9goXvTXpEzqT3_jCyZlo-KO8Urcm8aAQwTMa5U"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Dec 22, 2013","updated":1534867695000,"version":"0.36","recentChanges":"Asymmetric time settings<br>Configurable engine time for playing without clock<br>Several improvements for slow engines<br>Chinese and Japanese locales added","comments":[],"appId":"nl.tengen.gridmaster","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.tengen.gridmaster&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Word & Number Games","description":"Are you looking for word games and quizzes?

If the last two cards of a suite is on each end of the table, the game is said to be &#39;blocked&#39; the player that has the lowest count will be the winner of that game. In a game of &#39;first to six&#39; the player that reaches six first is the winner of the whole set.","summary":"A dominoes game that uses the rules in Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.","installs":"50,000+","minInstalls":50000,"score":4.199029,"scoreText":"4.2","ratings":824,"reviews":330,"histogram":{"1":43,"2":31,"3":98,"4":199,"5":453},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"size":"54M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"AxiomJa","developerId":"7187364366043034123","developerEmail":"dadunn95@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"https://jamaicanstyledominoes.com","developerAddress":"77 Spring Garden Drive,\nBushy Park,\nSt. Catherine, Jamaica\nJABWI","privacyPolicy":"http://jsdonline.axiomarray.com/privacy/","genre":"Board","genreId":"GAME_BOARD","icon":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xY6B1vGUkF3ZHxOnuoliMKuTcUMI3CxwYd-fP3AbBg_wtY7r0cltbVV01Gq98ssbTFo","headerImage":"https://lh6.ggpht.com/eVczjntmwNOmRChRYu6GGjfajKSNEw2DyG0iJhkkmsgxUis6VKBkfueXMnX0GMgTakJC","screenshots":["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5p9GL5NKlfJ_JjBaqZAAsviphT73MgddQ7MYm620U3LBhwA6wm1kwEuOvB2C9m8sOSRH","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pAMKV2v9bZLLTgsjJYP7-Nz1lbTxWzll4CXE3AVHZyO9NirfF05Ggn_hgEpxoNK9VQ","https://lh3.ggpht.com/ULQWvCrwyFenr2S7yzK36S1MHvrPoPx1EpbKXrnHb0vCtp4-tgd90sCZCPR8Du1sy-uP","https://lh6.ggpht.com/i2jClfbv6e4QXt-N0EWdCflLBjaSlNv-0slG5PNH63WpS9B_LRHSs5GAQzLuhlodwv2i","https://lh3.ggpht.com/mJrMbwO8z6E8Nl7SrvozJBxZRCyA5OMfVF6JdxEw_kqpXXsNL3K9TIxplStxJOUu2g","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8GU5NZvTsxIOvem7j-q54QAJZHIekJTBxhI_rmSRXV56zK72gah6zGcVUNNpnM4KLF0","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4LOj-EawRHgGTM8bkU95ZROL1GD8sHReeXyC3r1O_tWoqIWbQISmueVVR55Ho7gQFvQb","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TLBydaCyi17BejJLULRWl4phMU86LEuD2QSjGn0Rmnk31X0glWY-WAFmjOckUT4DoIQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AkDI2ft6Ay9aHMSE7QPUTKqjJ-pTw_sBumA3Q6IgMR4uUV8L3ANDKglBELe2qsG2xbTG","https://lh4.ggpht.com/_lmUMZs-qVikB1iOw4uy_sx2SkAqQwiCLHjsg-rN7eTu9Ay_Y8uOXwi5Qq47DzMt2e8","https://lh4.ggpht.com/RJob9IiCnrkdF6n8s9qEmvmftS01NXqmq0PSUAxfiab6HQn3JErsYg5zmy5e5DN8CQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q6aqggD23iQpYs5I4Y47EX0tNai03QqVSMaKpPnO38zuEMCkPscsSzznH0oZ0pvoNTU","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7ibxwUj2zX6hMHQBhxfjGDfIkK8CAHdCJ5vSDfejPJWdAjusPucSrj3Gt46PZy5MrQ","https://lh3.ggpht.com/LTtw1E-dKwzGsW-NqNqLRr5TpmHWfh73XqQ0tr_KRAsN34OT-9Y_PW_x7Mz2q_npE42k","https://lh6.ggpht.com/yc9X54tI08KsImCnVObUqdU7RU1tHLVyXFyot39wuzOSR3_vBH7P53hMIBhUi7pK3w"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jan 19, 2015","updated":1532482666000,"version":"4.06","recentChanges":"Get ready for the new UI and improved User Experience. <br>Voice notes in online play (Requires Microphone permission).<br>Paadie Pose for online play.<br>Minor bug fixes.<br>(Ability to control domino size on the board by pressing the player 1 name )","comments":[],"appId":"com.mygdx.YardieStyleDominoes.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mygdx.YardieStyleDominoes.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Yahtzee Dice King","description":"Join and play Yahtzee Dice King with peoples from around the world.\r\n\r\nYahtzee Dice King is a Yatzy online multiplayer game.
