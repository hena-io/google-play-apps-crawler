Remember what you have learnt for surviving a zombie disaster and use that knowledge in this zombie strategy game to defeat the undead.\r\n\r\nThe civilization as we know it is gone, and now it is the time to create a new free world. However, it won’t be easy. Anarchy reigns, and zombies are a plague. They are not very smart, but they are everywhere, and they are legion.\r\n\r\nBuild your own defensive shelter, and turn it into a fortress. Find lost survivors, like a nurse, a sheriff, or the sniper and convince them to join your faction. Together you will be able to improve the base with rooms full of guns, flamethrowers, machine guns, traps, and grenade launchers.\r\n\r\nBut the road to survival will be full of dangers. Anarchy, bandits and zombies, reign the post-apocalyptic world. Survival does not only depends on staying away of zombies, it is also important to defend your shelter from bandits, and thieves. Other survivors have built their own shelters, and they see your base as a threat. In the post-apocalypse land, every new shelter is a dangerous enemy. Trust is not a human quality anymore, but an exception.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT THE PLAGUE\r\nLead your squadron against zombie hordes, and defeat the undead. Survive in the special events, and get resources to help your people. There is a war against the undead, and you can help finish it.\r\n\r\nFIGHT FOR YOUR SURVIVAL\r\nAttack other bases to survive. Be aware of the traps, the machine guns, flamethrowers, cannons, and grenade launchers. Study their defenses, and develop a good strategy to attack the shelter. \r\n\r\nDEFEND WHAT IS YOURS\r\nPrepare your team to defend your base, and configure traps, machine guns, flamethrowers, cannons, and grenade launchers to protect your shelter from the zombie attacks. And do not underestimate survivors. Humans from other shelters will try to attack your base.\r\n\r\nRECRUIT SURVIVORS\r\nFind survivors, and build with them a safe shelter, far from zombies, and the anarchy in the world. There are more than 20 unique survivors in this apocalyptic zombie world.\r\nFind the sniper, the sheriff, the nurse, or the youtuber, and bring them together to attack the zombies.\r\n\r\nNEGOTIATE WITH OTHER SETTLEMENTS\r\nAnarchy reigns, and everyone is an enemy, but it does not have to be that way forever. Contact with other shelters, and ally with them. Building a new world free of zombies is hard. Negotiate with other bases if you want to succeed.\r\n\r\nBUILD THE BEST SHELTER\r\nThe world is over, but that does not mean survivors should live badly. Manage your shelter, and improve it to have space for more survivors, add entertainment rooms, and farmlands. Grow plants, recycle rust resources, and establish a self-sufficient community.\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES:\r\n- Online Survival zombie game.\r\n- Build your base from scratch, and defend it from zombies, and other survivors.\r\n- Attack other shelters to get more resources.\r\n- Survive the zombie apocalypse, and recruit new survivors.\r\n- Defeat the undead to build a new free world.\r\n- Amazing zombie battles during special events.\r\n- Prepare a good defensive strategy with traps, flamethrowers, machine guns, grenade launchers, and cannons.\r\n- Strategy PvP online battles.\r\n- All game modes can be played for free.\r\n- More than 20 unique survivors: a nurse, a sniper, a youtuber, a sheriff, ….\r\n- Sign in to Google Play Games to save your progress.\r\n\r\nZombie Faction is an online strategy free to play game.

Also enjoy the mini game included, which will allow the user getting coins to get new features for the laser pointer.\r\n\r\n*** Disclaimer: This is just laser pointer simulated on the screen of your mobile device, phone or tablet. Don’t think this a real laser pointer, nor think that a real laser light will come out of your phone through the camera. ***\r\n\r\nThe first time you use this laser pointer simulator app, there is a laser pointer that you can use from the very first moment. Instructions and recommendations about how to use the laser pointer are given in different parts of this free game. To make the laser ray flowing, just tap on the laser pointer. Clicking repeated times on it shall provide you with plenty of coins, which will help you unlock the strobe light feature. Initially the stroboscopic light feature is locked, but getting coins is one part of what the player needs in order to achieve unlocking this awesome feature. The faster you tap on the laser pointer, the more coins and bonus you get. Tap as fast as you can, or keep your finger on top of the laser pointer during 20 seconds, that way, the player charges the energy of the laser pointer to the maximum until a red blast happens, simulating the screen of your mobile device getting broken and simulating electric shocks wherever you tap on the screen of your phone or tablet. Click on the back button of your device to continue playing this free game.\r\n\r\nThere are some other ways to increase the number of coins, as for example: passing levels on the mini game you can find as part of this game, sharing on social networks, downloading more games or watching videos. All these ways to augment the rewards are found in several screens of the laser pointer simulated app.\r\n\r\nThe mini game is essential in the laser pointer simulator game. The player needs to pass at least 35 levels in order to get the super feature of the strobe light. So, just playing the mini game is enough to achieve unlocking it. Every level the user passes, 10 free coins of reward to increase the counter of coins. The mini game is so fun. The goal is to put all the left squares on the imaginary circumference where the squares that rotate around the big central square are. Each time the user taps on the screen, a small square is thrown against the central square. Every level follows a pattern of movements, so if the player finds a difficult level, the best way to pass it is memorizing the pattern of moves., so the small squares can be thrown in a wise way. Some features of the mini game:\r\nOne tap game play. Just one tap is enough to throw a small square to the central square.\r\nMinimalistic design. Simple and fun can go along together.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy and get fun playing the laser pointer simulated 100 2 X beams red blast. We would be happy to improve the laser pointer simulator app with your help and according to what the users would like to have in the coming versions. We would appreciate your feedback through ratings, comments or emails.","descriptionHTML":"Laser pointer simulated 100 2 X beams red blast, a super fun app that contains a laser pointer simulator.

Genisys is destroyed and Skynet is offline, but the future war is far from over. Engage in large-scale strategic warfare and rejoin the struggle between machine and man. Build your base, attack your enemies and pave the way to victory for your clan in tactical multiplayer.\r\n\r\nPlarium, developer of the hit titles Vikings: War of Clans and Throne: Kingdom at War, has created a deep strategy MMO in the Terminator universe. Set directly after the events of the film, Terminator Genisys: Future War offers players a chance to reset the future with addictive gameplay, constant action, and massive clan warfare.\r\n\r\nWith two different playable factions, you can choose to take the role of a Resistance Commander or the leader of Skynet’s Core, and either save the last of humanity or crush it under your cybernetic heel.\r\n\r\nJohn Connor is MIA, and the Resistance is broken. As a human commander, it is up to you to rebuild humanity’s most determined military force, find and recruit survivors to your cause, and stop the machines from reactivating Skynet.

Join a guild, help your teammates launch attacks, and hold off enemy raids in true real-time fashion.\r\n\r\nBREED LEGENDARY DRAGONS\r\n\r\nWar Dragons has more than one hundred unique dragons possessing different attack styles, spell abilities, and classes. Breed your dragons to create an even more powerful army. See if you can unlock the furious behemoth Khrysos and dominate the battlefield!\r\n\r\nCOMBINE FORCES WITH FRIENDS\r\n\r\nStart or join a guild to combine forces with other dragon lords. With true synchronous multiplayer, you can chat with teammates in real time and coordinate attack and defense strategies against other guilds.\r\n\r\nBUILD IMPENETRABLE FORTRESSES\r\n\r\nStrategize and build your island fortress with the optimal combination of lightning, ballista, and archer towers to best protect your base against enemy attack.\r\n\r\nASCEND TO THE THRONE\r\n\r\nParticipate in a wide variety of weekly events with the chance to win rewards, such as rare dragon eggs and treasure hunts, for you and your guild. Claw your way up the leaderboards to assert yourself as one of the world’s top dragon lords.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE CHAOTIC BEAUTY OF WAR DRAGONS\r\n\r\nThe game was built on the Mantis Engine, a proprietary 3D game engine, featuring state-of-the-art graphics and cinematics.

Zoolax Inc. just bought a creepy antique shop as a side investment. You need to face the darkness to escape the nightmare. \r\nThe antique shop came with the infamous ancient dolls known as the Evil Clowns. You must monitor the security cameras to survive not just for five nights, but six dark nights while faced with nightly puzzles and challenges at the Zoolax Antique Shop. The Evil Clowns are cursed by fearful and mysterious magical forces of darkness. They love to lurk around at nights, and shift places. They will make your life an epic nightmare. So, you must monitor them and follow the company’s instructions to protect yourself. There are two sets of security cameras to monitor: the ground level and the sewer level. Each night, you will face a new challenge as the Evil Clowns are creeping around. Zoolax Scientists are working around the clock to uncover the mysteries behind these cursed clowns. This will be a frightening and horrifying experience. Every night, the Zoolax CEO will give you precise instructions to endure this survival game. The amazing graphics and visuals make this a great horror survival game.

Zoolax Inc. just bought a creepy antique shop as a side investment. You need to face the darkness to escape the nightmare. <br>The antique shop came with the infamous ancient dolls known as the Evil Clowns. You must monitor the security cameras to survive not just for five nights, but six dark nights while faced with nightly puzzles and challenges at the Zoolax Antique Shop. The Evil Clowns are cursed by fearful and mysterious magical forces of darkness. They love to lurk around at nights, and shift places. They will make your life an epic nightmare. So, you must monitor them and follow the company’s instructions to protect yourself. There are two sets of security cameras to monitor: the ground level and the sewer level. Each night, you will face a new challenge as the Evil Clowns are creeping around. Zoolax Scientists are working around the clock to uncover the mysteries behind these cursed clowns. This will be a frightening and horrifying experience. Every night, the Zoolax CEO will give you precise instructions to endure this survival game.

Evolution: Battle for Utopia is a new, free multi-genre online blockbuster with unprecedented action, RPG and strategy elements combined in one game!\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n— An evolution of storytelling! Utopia is a barren, deadly world that survived an apocalypse... But there’s also a blend of classic, hi-tech sci-fi style in it, as well as dark mysteries to uncover.\r\n— An evolution of gameplay! Fight your enemies in real time battles, experience a unique combat system! Although Evolution has the strengths of an Action game, the combat system is easy to pick up and challenging to master.\r\n— Build a colony, fortify your base and protect it from attacks with a fortification system of turrets, like a Tower Defense game.\r\n— Terraform the planet: turn scorched wasteland into a blossoming paradise! Unique extraterrestrial civilization’s technology is in your hands! Do the evolution!\r\n— This means war! Destroy enemies the size of a skyscraper with ballistic missiles!\r\n— Explore a world in one of the most epic games in the history of Android! Planet Utopia hides many surprises! Uncover all of its secrets in the exciting adventures!\r\n— Upgrade and equip your character to destroy the most dangerous creatures and defeat enemy soldiers!\r\n— Fight alongside your allies, including (but not limited to) a faithful cyborg dog named Fido!\r\n— Collect resources and multiply your wealth! Gather more and more by building mines or by opening electronic locks with a special interface consisting of multiple interesting mini games.\r\n— Allies and enemies await! You will gain new friends, but you’ll also meet sinister enemies... And don’t forget about greedy competitors whom you’ll fight in PvP battles!\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia about us:\r\n— Mobile games have come a long way in recent years and now some gaming apps rival in quality and technical brilliance even some of the console titles. Evolution: Battle for Utopia, recently released by My.com is one of the newest gems to hit the Google Play. – Examiner.com\r\n— Looks great. No ridiculous energy mechanic. Features a surprisingly entertaining touch screen combat system. – GameZebo.com \r\n— Where Evolution: Battle for Utopia succeeds most is in the overall narrative. There's a ton of backstory to all of your crew, the enemies, and the environment, paired with beautifully rendered cutscenes that show your ship transforming into your base and other portions of the planet being terraformed for habitable use. It's definitely a nice surprise to see a lot more time and detail put into modes beyond the standard gameplay. – GameRevolution.com\r\n— So far, it’s been a well balanced system and, all things considered, Evolution: Battle for Utopia has plenty of treats waiting for Strategy-RPG fans to delight in. – 148Apps.com\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom space adventures to post apocalypse!

Hold the tower rush and beat epic enemies as they are at the door it is either them or your towers, either defend the space realm or fail in the epic fire of your falling towers. And remember - tower wins a battle, but your mind wins you a sci fi tower war.

Do you like tycoon-style building games that offer you literally infinite options in how you create and design your city life? Then this new citybuilder game is exactly what you are looking for. It is based on the City Island 2 - Building Sim city building game but with a fresh new interaction design and a complete new way to collect your cash. Now there is always something to do and always cash to collect!\r\n\r\nStarting with simple houses that grow into huge skyscrapers and skylines, this game will test your management planning and organizational skills. Lay out parks, streets, entertainment, and employment areas. Don't forget to provide basic city services like electricity, sanitation, and police and fire protection. Your citizens will be thankful and more productive the happier you make them in their custom environment. \r\n\r\nBeautiful graphics are a key part of this exciting new \"tap\" game based on City Island 2. Lovely renderings of buildings, shops, and stadiums await you once you begin. The more you grow your city, the more decorative and detailed each building becomes. As you invest in amenities, your township becomes more and more like the dream community you imagined and grows to become a real metropolis.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of town building game that teaches as you play, increasing your knowledge of city planning, resource management, and the services required to make a city run. It offers real world rules on how your citizens interact with your developments. Custom options allow you to set up your city the way you see fit, and it allows you to change your gaming experience as you adjust to new challenges. \r\n\r\nBe sure to keep your citizens happy, or you won't generate the revenues you need to build the city of your dreams.

Challenge (online 2 player) & 3 Roll mode **\r\n\r\nUse your skill (& a little luck!) to match the dice rolled. Score bonuses & multi-bonuses for completing rows. Complete the board within 8 turns & score a completion bonus. (***see STRATEGY below for tips to maximize your score***)\r\n\r\nThe objective of Dice Match is to complete rows of random dice by matching them with the dice rolled at the top of the screen. The ultimate aim is to match every die on the game screen & score a completion bonus. You have 8 turns per game to try & match as many dice as possible. Every die you match scores points at the face value of that die.\r\n\r\nComplete rows vertically, horizontally & diagonally (corner to corner). Every row  completed scores you bonus points. When you complete more than 1 row at a time, you score a multi-row bonus. Complete the entire board & you score a completion bonus.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n* Customizable dice colors\r\n* 6 modes - Standard, Continuous, 3 Roll, Timed (Easy), Timed (Hard) & Challenge\r\n* Leaderboards & achievements\r\n* On-device top 10 high scores for each mode\r\n* Playing stats\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\nThe screen has 6 dice along the top & a grid of 36 dice that are randomly allocated values at the start of the game. Begin by tapping on the Start button to take your first roll of the dice along the top. If the 'Show Match Hints' option in Settings is turned on, any dice on the grid that match any number rolled at the top will be highlighted & can be selected. As you select matches in the grid, your selection & the corresponding rolled die will turn blue. A blue rolled die cannot be used again in the current turn - however you can make it available again by tapping on a selected (blue) match in the grid to deselect it. You can also move a selected match by tapping on any other matched die with the same value. Once you have selected 6 matches in the grid (or less if you rolled a number that doesn't have a corresponding match), tap the Roll button to take your next turn. The dice you selected will change to red to show they are now locked & not available to be selected again. If you completed a row, all the dice in that row will change to green to indicate that the row is complete. The game ends after 8 turns or if you complete the grid in less than 8 turns.\r\n\r\nSTRATEGY\r\nMaximize your score by completing multiple rows in a turn. Fill the board from the inside out or outside in & hold off completing rows for as long as possible. Try to have many with only 1 die left to select so that when you start completing rows, you can complete as many as possible per turn. This will earn you the highest bonuses. Completing a board in less than 8 turns will earn you a bonus (the less turns, the higher the bonus) & completing multiple boards in Continuous mode will earn you big scores. Good luck!\r\n\r\nMODES\r\n\r\nCONTINUOUS\r\nKeep playing when you complete a game board. A new board is set up & your score & any rolls left from the previous board are carried over.\r\n\r\n3 ROLL\r\n7 turns per board, 3 rolls per turn. After each roll choose which matches to keep by tapping on them & the matching rolled dice are kept out of the next roll. Game continues when a board is completed, but you can only have a maximum of 10 rolls at the start of a board. \r\n\r\nTIMED\r\nYou get 6 seconds in hard mode & 8 seconds in easy to complete each turn. When the time counts down to 0, your next turn is rolled automatically.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE\r\nPlay online against another player on the same board. The object is to beat the other player's score.\r\n\r\nSCORING\r\nMatched Die - face value\r\nHorizontal Row - 75\r\nVertical Row - 100\r\nDiagonal Row - 150\r\nMultiple Rows - 200 x the number of rows\r\nAll Dice Matched - 1000 + 1000 x the number of rolls left in the game\r\n\r\nDICE COLORS (can be customized in Settings screen)\r\nYellow - matches one (or more) of the dice rolled & can be selected.\r\nBlue - is selected & will be locked at the start of the next turn.\r\nRed - is locked & no longer usable on the current board.\r\nGreen - is part of a completed row.","descriptionHTML":"** Now with Challenge (online 2 player) &amp; 3 Roll mode **<br><br>Use your skill (&amp; a little luck!) to match the dice rolled.

No 1 storage wars: an auctioneer & pawn shop owner realistic experience. This is the 1st bid wars with REAL PRICES and LIFE-LIKE ITEMS to bid. \r\n\r\nA RECORD HOLDER\r\nSE holds the record for items (over 1100), collections (about 65) and vehicles (7 types). It contains unique features like the warehouse, the pawn shop, items exchange and collections.\r\n\r\nYou will compete with real players for items left in compartments. You will also be selling items for a profit at your own pawn shop. Gather precious collections, create and manage your fleet of up to 7 different types of vehicles, but most importantly - make smart decisions! \r\n\r\nOVER 1100 REAL ITEMS\r\nAll items at garage auction are life-like items of real value. Make a use of your life experience to decide: bid or not! You can also exchange items with other players and consult them with experts to determine their market value.\r\n\r\nBID OR NOT TO BID? - THAT IS THE QUESTION \r\nThe value of those yard sale items varies from 1$ to... you will find out. It's different in every location. If you don't see valuable items, it may be better to walk away and not to bid in the auction wars.\r\n\r\nSINGLE & MULTIPLAYER AUCTIONS\r\nStorage Empire Pawn Shop Wars is the first auction wars game with multiplayer! Try to beat real bidders and pickers or play against canny AI. Use CHAT to comment.\r\nYou buy items for re-sale. The only way to get them is to win an auction. Would you succeed in storage wars and bid wars?\r\n\r\nOVER 50 COLLECTIONS\r\nThere's more than just bidding. Gather up all items to complete a collection and get extra profit. A successful collector levels up quickly. Collections are bonded to a particular location or locations. So far there are 65 collections. \r\n\r\n7 TYPES OF CARS AND A TRAILER\r\nYou can bid and buy as much as you can carry in your car. So get more vehicles, upgrade them, and buy a trailer to get access to a nearly unlimited number of auctions. Driving around the country is expensive. The journey cost relies on the distance and fuel economy. \r\n\r\nTHE PAWN SHOP\r\nAll items bought at an auction are sold in your own pawn shop. As in real life, it takes a long time to get your money back. Expand and upgrade the pawn shop to sell faster. \r\n\r\nTHE WAREHOUSE\r\nThere's a place in your pawn shop where you keep all the items you won in storage wars. You can leave a few items for later, they will not be sold. It is particularly useful for trading items. So it’s not just bidding.\r\n\r\nTHE ASSISTANT\r\nThe assistant is your right-hand man who creates a point of difference for your business. Every auctioneer needs a bit of help sometimes. You can develop your assistant's skills - marketing, logistic and management. \r\n\r\nLEADERBOARD & RANKING\r\nThe leader board reflects your gaming performance in this auction wars game. So far only cash counts. The amount of money invested in either: items, vehicles and the pawn shop has no influence on your position rank. \r\n\r\nUNLIMITED LEVELS\r\nYou need to get a certain number of experience points to level up. Winning auctions, finding rare items and gathering collections would provide you extra rewards.\r\n\r\nFREE TO PLAY \r\nStorage Empire Pawn Shop Wars is a free auction game. However, some additional features require payment. Please note that Storage Empire requires Internet connection to play.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNITY\r\nShare with us you best bid wars tactic and your garage sale experience.

It contains unique features like the warehouse, the pawn shop, items exchange and collections.<br><br>You will compete with real players for items left in compartments. You will also be selling items for a profit at your own pawn shop. Gather precious collections, create and manage your fleet of up to 7 different types of vehicles, but most importantly - make smart decisions! <br><br>OVER 1100 REAL ITEMS<br>All items at garage auction are life-like items of real value. Make a use of your life experience to decide: bid or not! You can also exchange items with other players and consult them with experts to determine their market value.<br><br>BID OR NOT TO BID? - THAT IS THE QUESTION <br>The value of those yard sale items varies from 1$ to... you will find out. It&#39;s different in every location. If you don&#39;t see valuable items, it may be better to walk away and not to bid in the auction wars.<br><br>SINGLE &amp; MULTIPLAYER AUCTIONS<br>Storage Empire Pawn Shop Wars is the first auction wars game with multiplayer! Try to beat real bidders and pickers or play against canny AI. Use CHAT to comment.<br>You buy items for re-sale. The only way to get them is to win an auction. Would you succeed in storage wars and bid wars?<br><br>OVER 50 COLLECTIONS<br>There&#39;s more than just bidding. Gather up all items to complete a collection and get extra profit. A successful collector levels up quickly. Collections are bonded to a particular location or locations. So far there are 65 collections. <br><br>7 TYPES OF CARS AND A TRAILER<br>You can bid and buy as much as you can carry in your car. So get more vehicles, upgrade them, and buy a trailer to get access to a nearly unlimited number of auctions. Driving around the country is expensive. The journey cost relies on the distance and fuel economy. <br><br>THE PAWN SHOP<br>All items bought at an auction are sold in your own pawn shop. As in real life, it takes a long time to get your money back. Expand and upgrade the pawn shop to sell faster. <br><br>THE WAREHOUSE<br>There&#39;s a place in your pawn shop where you keep all the items you won in storage wars. You can leave a few items for later, they will not be sold. It is particularly useful for trading items. So it’s not just bidding.<br><br>THE ASSISTANT<br>The assistant is your right-hand man who creates a point of difference for your business. Every auctioneer needs a bit of help sometimes. You can develop your assistant&#39;s skills - marketing, logistic and management. <br><br>LEADERBOARD &amp; RANKING<br>The leader board reflects your gaming performance in this auction wars game. So far only cash counts. The amount of money invested in either: items, vehicles and the pawn shop has no influence on your position rank. <br><br>UNLIMITED LEVELS<br>You need to get a certain number of experience points to level up. Winning auctions, finding rare items and gathering collections would provide you extra rewards.<br><br>FREE TO PLAY <br>Storage Empire Pawn Shop Wars is a free auction game.
